      <h1>International Student From Morocco Wants to Make American her Home – and She is Also Helping Other Students to Do So</h1>

      <p class='byline'> By Irene Spezzamonte </p>


      <p> When Ghita Bensilmane came to the United States the first time in 2011 her heart was beating at the rhythm of the Star-Spangled Banner. She had spent her entire childhood in an American school in her hometown, Casablanca in Morocco and when the
        moment to apply to college came, it was natural for her to start her American dream.</p>


      <div class="hotspot">

        <div id="fact1" class="spot" data-description='"My parents put me and my siblings in an American school because they thought it would have been great for our careers to learn English." Bensilmane, 24, said. "What it ended up happening was that
        we became half American in our heads and culturally."'></div>
        <div id="fact2" class="spot" data-description='"’Till these days our parents don’t understand aspects of our identities that are pretty
American." Bensilmane said.'></div>

      <p> And so Boston University opened its door to Bensilmane and Bensilmane opened her heart to America. But after earning her bachelor' s degree, in 2016 she was forced to go back to her native country because her visa had expired and even though she
        had the possibility to have a job at Snapchat, the company wouldn’t have been able to sponsor her H-1B visa, which would have allowed Belsilmane to work and live in the United States. </p>

      <p>The year Bensilmane left the country, 2016, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services received a total of 233,000 H-1B petitions, but only 65,000 were approved under the Immigration Act of 1990.</p>

      <p> But Belsilmane was not done. </p>

      <p>One year later she came back to the United States to pursue her Master’s degree in social journalism at CUNY Graduate School of Journalism and this time she came to the big apple to stay. She wasn’t thinking only about herself, however. She wanted
        to bring a change to the school that would have helped all international students at CUNY-J.</p>

      <p>Belsilmane decided to pen a letter to Dean Sarah Bartlett asking to designate the Master’s degree as STEM. This would have allowed international students to extend their work permit after graduation.</p>

      <p> International students can indeed apply for Optional Practical Training as soon as they graduate from an American college. The OPT is usually one year-long. However, if you graduate with a STEM degree you are allowed to extend your OPT for an additional
        two years making it a total of three years during which an international students can stay in states and work. This is a great advantage for the 1 million international students currently studying in the country because under an international
        student visa it is not possible to work. </p>

      <p> The restrictive laws and the election of Donald Trump had an impact on international students enrollement in the United States. Data from the United States Department of State - Bureau of Consular Affairs shows that the number of international students
        enrolling in American universities declined by 25 percent. Having the opportunity to stay in the country a work for an extended period of time is an advantage for those international students who wish to build a career in the States.

      <p>
        When the news broke that CUNY-J became a STEM designated program, the response from international students was overwhelming.</p>

      <p>“This is really life changing for all of us international students. At this moment, I am very emotional and can't quite articulate what this feels.” Maria Montanez wrote. </p>

      <p> “This really changes our lives and careers, and our families will thanks you forever.” Costanza Gallardo added.</p>

        <div id="fact3" class="spot " data-description='"It feels unfair that after four years of studying in the US they government kind of looks at you and says ‘thank you for your tuition, goodbye’ so that’s why I decided to do something about it. " Bensilmane
        said.'></div>

      <p>
        But Bensilmane was not done. She brought that change to Texas after she met Olivia Rempel, a fellow international student at UC Berkeley, while she was getting trained as a student leader with ProPublica's Documenting Hate project. There she told her
        about the STEM designation and provided her with some advice on how to change the designation program at Berkley.
      </p>

      <p>
        “After months of hard work by Olivia and her colleagues, UC Berkeley's journalism department has announced its programs would be getting the STEM designation, meaning current and former students will now get three years after school.” Bensilmane said.</p>
      <p>
        “Moral of the story: if you're an international student in the US, and you hope to gain substantial work experience here after college, you may want to look into whether or not your program may qualify as STEM.” Bensilmane said. “Laslty, if you hear any
        talk of Trump trying to take away the 2-year STEM extension, fight it with all your might! Shut it down!”
